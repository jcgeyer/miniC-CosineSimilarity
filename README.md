# miniC-CosineSimilarity

This repo processes two files of miniC code to determine their similarity.  
To do this, we generate a vector of embeddings based on each file's AST (generated by the parser and semantic analysus), then using cosine similarity to compare vectors and return a similarity score.  
To test this, run `make comparison_test`. To edit the files to be compared, go to the `comparison_test` rule in the makefile and change the filenames.
